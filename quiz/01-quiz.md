###  textbook questions

false -  the computing industry has not improved quite as rapidly as the transportation industry

true -  the agricultural and industrial revolutions each transformed society.  computers have led to a relatively recent information revolution

true -  from the mid 1980s to early 200s, processor performance improved each year at an average of 52%

true -  growth in processor performance has slowed in 2002

true -  power was a factor in the slowing of processor performance growth

false -  manufacturers continue to design single processor systems and increase processor performance through new technology driven improvements

as computing systems move to multicore microprocessors, programmers need to rewrite their programs to obtain performance benefits

parallel programming seeks to improve program performance

how should programmers write code to maximize the benefits of parallel programming? -  divide a program into sub tasks so all processors run about the same amount of time

true -  parallel programming becomes more difficult as the number of processor cores increased

true -  go game ai is a benchmark

true -  a workload is typically a set of benchmarks

false -  all spec benchmarks have similar instruction count, cpi, and clock cycle time characteristics

false - a smaller specratio indicates better performance, specratio is the inverse of execution time

false - power is not a useful evaluation metric in spec benchmarks

**1.6.1  execution time and throughput**

at joes car wash a car enters the wash, and exists 5 minutes later.  5 minutes is the - execution time

at joes car wash a car enters the wash, and exists 5 minutes later.  however 1 minute after a car enters, the next car can center.  thus, once full, the car wash outputs 1 clean car per minute.  1 car per minute is the -
