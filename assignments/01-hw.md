1.  **According to the definition of a credit hour describe in syllabus, briefly explain how many total hours you are expected to spend to succeed in this course**

a.  **in a normal week**

9 hours per week, 3 hours in class and 6 hours outside of class.

b.  **in a 15 week semester**

2.  a.  **What are the instructor's student / office hours?**

Tuesday 11:00 am - 12:30 pm, Wednesday 10:00 am - 11:30 am

b.  **How to contact the instructor during the student / office hours?**

In-person during office hours or via email

3.  **Using the lecture slides, briefly discuss**

a.  **computer**

a computer is a machine that receives inputs, manipulates and or stores data, and provides useful outputs.

b.  **computer architecture**

computer architecture or digital computer organization is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems.  computer organization helps optimize performance-based products.  it can also be interpreted as the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system.

c.  **von neumann architecture**

the von neumann model is a computer architecture model designed by von neumann, it describes a system where the computer hardware is organized in a specific way to perform calculations and store data.  the scheme is comprised of the following components:

-  a processing unit with both an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers
-  a control unit that includes an instruction register and a program counter
-  memory that stores data and instructions
-  external mass storage
-  input and output mechanism

d.  **pure harvard architecture**

the pure harvard architecture is a computer architecture with separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data.  it's contrasted with the von neumann architecture where the program instructions and data share the same memory and pathways.  this architecture is often used in real time processing or low power applications.  the components of the pure harvard architecture are the following:

-  alu - arithmetic logic unit
-  instruction memory
-  data memory
-  input/output
-  control unit

e.  **PDP-8 architecture**

1.  **Based on the class lectures, briefly discuss major five steps to execute an instruction in a simple computer system**

-  level 5 the problem oriented language level, you translate the program via a compiler to level 4
-  level 4 the assembly language level, you translate the program via an assembler to level 3
-  level 3 the operating system machine level, you partially interpret the program via the operating system to level 2
-  level 2 the instruction set architecture level, you interpret the microprogram or directly execute the program to level 1
-  level 1 the microarchitecture level, you execute the program via hardware to level 0
-  level 0 the digital logic level

1.  **Based on the class lectures, clearly discuss the major five steps to execute the following five separate instructions in a simple computer system**

a.  **`[DReg-1] = 0`**

b.  **`[Mem-1] = 1`**

c.  **`[Mem-2] = 2 * [Mem-2]`**

d.  **`Go to Mem-3`**
