**question 1 discuss six important classes of computers.  for each class, mention at least two notable features**

personal computers (pc)

computers designed for use by an individual, usually incorporating a graphics display, a keyboard, and a mouse.  one notable feature is that they emphasize delivery of good performance and are specifically designed for individual use, meaning that they are not shared with other users, and are typically used for personal tasks such as word processing, web browsing, gaming, software development, and more.  another notable feature is that they are designed to have the following components such as a processor cpu, memory ram, storage, graphics processing unit cpu, input / output ports, operating system, display, connectivity to the internet, and more.

servers

a computer used for running larger programs for multiple users, often simultaneously, and typically accessed only via a network.  one notable feature is that they are oriented to carrying large workloads, workloads such as single complex applications for scientific or engineering applications, or small jobs such as serving web pages for a large web server.  another feature is that they have the same technology as desktop computers, but provide for greater computing in storage, input / output, and networking.  they are emphasized for computation but rather they are optimized for for reliability, throughput, availability, and flexibility.

supercomputers

a class of computers with the highest performance and cost; they are configured as servers and typically cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.  one feature is that they consist of tens of thousands of processors optimized for parallel processing, have many terabytes of memory, can perform massive computations across thousands or millions of cores, and cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.  another feature is that they are designed for high end scientific and engineering calculations for weather forecasting, oil exploration, protein structure determination, and other large scale problems.  

embedded computers

embedded computers are the largest class of computers and span the widest range of applications and performance, they are computers inside another device used for running one predetermined application or collection of software.  one feature is that they are low cost and have lower tolerance for failure.  embedded computers are designed for embedded applications and have very unique application requirements that combine a minimum performance with stringent limitations on cost or power.  

personal mobile devices (pmd)

pmd's are small wireless devices that connected to the internet, they rely on batteries for power, and software is installed by downloading applications.  some conventional examples of personal mobile devices are smart phones and tablets.  one feature of pmd's are that they do not always have a keyboard or mouse, but rather a touch screen interface.  another feature is that they are designed to be portable and have a long battery life, and are designed to be used for personal tasks such as web browsing, email, social media, and more.

warehouse scale computers (wsc)

warehouse scale computer are designed to operate at the scale of an entire data center and support large scale internet facing application.  one feature is that these systems are optimized for managing and delivering services like cloud computing which refers to a large collection of servers that provide servers over the internet.  cloud computing has providers such as amazon web services, google cloud platform, and microsoft azure and are used to be rented dynamically varying numbers of servers as a utility.  a second feature of warehouse scale computer is that they are commodity servers networked together to act as a single cohesive system, they focus on scalability, energy efficiency , fault tolerance, and manage vast amounts of data and user requests.

quantum computers

another additional class of computers are quantum computers which are designed to solve certain problems that classical computers find unsolvable.  they excel at tasks involving massive parallelism, optimization problems, cryptography, and simulating quantum systems.  one feature is that they reply on quantum bits (qubits) instead of classical bits, qubits can represent 0, 1, or both simultaneously which is a concept called superposition.  another feature is that they require an extremely precise conditions to operating including near-absolute zero temperatures and magnetic shielding to prevent interference from the environment.

**question 2  discuss the great ideas about computer architecture**

design for moore's law

moore's law is the observation that integrated circuit recourses double every 18-24 months, it resulted from a 1965 prediction of growth in ic integrated circuit capacity made by gordon moore who is one of the founders of intel.  

**question 3  match from the great ideas about computer architecture to the following ideas from other fields**
  
**a -  suspension bridge cables**

**b -  aircraft and marine navigation systems that incorporate wind information**

**c -  express elevators in buildings**

**d -  library reserve desk**

**e -  adding electronic magnetic aircraft catapults (which are electrically powered as opposed to current stream powered models), allowed by the increased power generation offered by the new reactor technology**

**question 4  discuss three major levels of program code**

**question 5  discuss important components of a computer -  cpu, memory, input / output devices**
