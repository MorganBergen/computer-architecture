###  terms

**personal computer** -  a computer designed for use by an individual, usually incorporating a graphics display, a keyboard, and a mouse.

**server** -  a computer used for running larger programs for multiple users, often simultaneously, and typically accessed only via a network.

**supercomputer** -  a class of computers with the highest performance and cost; they are configured as servers and typically cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.

**terabyte tb** -  originally $1,099,511,627,776$ / $2^{40}$ bytes, although communications and secondary storage systems developers started using the term to mean $1,000,000,000,000$ or $10^{12}$ bytes.  to reduce confusion, we now use the term **tebibyte (tib**) for $20^{40}$ bytes, defining terabyte (tb) to mean $10^{12}$ bytes.

**embedded computer** -  a computer inside another device used for running one predetermined application or collection of software.

**multicore microprocessor** -  a microprocessor containing multiprocessors ("cores") in a single integrated circuit.

**ram** is an acronym for random access memory, it provides high-speed, short-term memory for your computer's cpu.  it can be read and changed in any order, typically used to specifically store working data and machine code.  

**cpu** is an acronym for central processing unit, it is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system.

**systems software** -  software that provides services that are commonly useful, including operating systems, compilers, loaders, and assemblers.

**operating system** supervising program that manages the resources of a computer for the benefit of the program that run on that computer.

**compiler** a program that translates high level language statements into assembly language statements.

**clock cycle** also called **tick**, **clock tick**, **clock period**, **clock** or **cycle** is teh time for one clock period, usually of the processor clock, which runs at a constant rate.

**clock period** the length of each clock cycle.

**cpu execution time** also called **cpu time**.  the actual time the cpu spends computing for a specific task.

**user cpu time**  the cpu time spent in a program itself.

**system cpu time** the cpu time spent in the operating system performing tasks on behalf of the program.

**response time** also called **execution time**.  the total time required for the computer to complete a task, including disk access, memory accesses, i/o activities, operating system overhead, cpu execution time, and so on.

**throughput** also called **bandwidth**.  another measure of performance, it is the number of tasks completed per unit time.

**clock cycles per instruction cpi**  average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment.

**instruction count** the number of instructions executed by a program.
