###  terms

**personal computer** -  a computer designed for use by an individual, usually incorporating a graphics display, a keyboard, and a mouse.

**server** -  a computer used for running larger programs for multiple users, often simultaneously, and typically accessed only via a network.

**supercomputer** -  a class of computers with the highest performance and cost; they are configured as servers and typically cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.

**terabyte tb** -  originally $1,099,511,627,776$ / $2^{40}$ bytes, although communications and secondary storage systems developers started using the term to mean $1,000,000,000,000$ or $10^{12}$ bytes.  to reduce confusion, we now use the term **tebibyte (tib**) for $20^{40}$ bytes, defining terabyte (tb) to mean $10^{12}$ bytes.

**embedded computer** -  a computer inside another device used for running one predetermined application or collection of software.

**personal mobile devices** -  are small wireless devices to connect to the internet; they rely on batteries for power, and software is installed by downloading apps.  conventional examples are smart phones and tablets.

**software as a service saas** -  delivers software and data as a service over the internet, usually via a thin program such as a browser that runs on local client devices, instead of binary code that must be installed, and runs wholly on that device.  example include web search and social networking.

**multicore microprocessor** -  a microprocessor containing multiprocessors ("cores") in a single integrated circuit.

**ram** is an acronym for random access memory, it provides high-speed, short-term memory for your computer's cpu.  it can be read and changed in any order, typically used to specifically store working data and machine code.  

**cpu** is an acronym for central processing unit, it is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system.

**systems software** -  software that provides services that are commonly useful, including operating systems, compilers, loaders, and assemblers.

**operating system** - supervising program that manages the resources of a computer for the benefit of the program that run on that computer.

**compiler** - a program that translates high level language statements into assembly language statements.

**binary digit** -  also called a **bit**.  one of the two numbers in base 2 or (0 or 1) that are the components of information.

**instruction** -  a command that computer hardware understands and obeys.

**assembler** -  a program that translates a symbolic version of instructions into the binary version.

**assembly language** -  a symbolic representation of machine instructions.

**high level programming language** -  a portable language such as c, c++, java, or visual basic that is composed of words and algebraic notation that can be translated by a compiler into assembly language.

**input device** -  a mechanism through which the computer is fed information, such as a keyboard.

**output device** -  a mechanism that conveys the result of a computation to a user, such as a display, or to another computer.

**liquid crystal display** -  a display technology using a thin layer of liquid polymers that can be used to transmit or block light according to whether a charge is applied.

**active matrix display** -  a liquid crystal display using a transistor to control the transmission of light at each individual pixel.

**pixel** -  the smallest individual picture element.  screens are composed of hundreds of thousands to millions of pixels, organized in a matrix.

**integrated circuit** -  also called a **chip**.  is a device combining dozens to millions of transistors.

**central processor unit cpu** -  also called processor.  the active part of the computer, which contains the datapath and control and which adds numbers, test numbers, signal i/o devices to active, and so on.

**datapath** -  the component of the processor that performs arithmetic operations.

**control** -  the component of the processor that commands the datapath, memory, and i/o devices according to the instructions of the program.

**memory** -  the storage area in which programs are kept when they are running and that contains the data needed by the running programs.

**dynamic random access memory dram** -  memory built as an integrated circuit; it provides random access to any location.  access times are 50 nanoseconds and cost per gigabyte in 2012 was about $5 to $10.

**cache memory** -  a small fast memory that acts as a buffer for a slower, larger memory.

**static random access memory sram** -  also memory built as an integrated circuit, but faster and less dense than dram.

**instruction set architecture** -  also called **architecture**.  an abstract interface between the hardware and lowest level software that encompasses all the information necessary to write a machine language program that will run correctly, including instructions, registers, memory access, i/o, and so on.

**implementation** -  hardware that obeys the architecture abstraction.

**volatile memory** -  storage, such as dram that retains data only if it is receiving power.

**nonvolatile memory** -  a form of memory that retains data even in the absence of a power source and that is used to store programs between runs.  a dvd disk is nonvolatile.

**main memory** -  also called **primary memory**.  memory used to hold programs while they are running; typically consists of dram in today's computers.

**secondary memory** -  nonvolatile memory used to store programs and data between runs; typically consists of flash memory in pmd (personal mobile devices) and magnetic disks in servers.

**magnetic disk** -  also called **hard disk**.  a form of nonvolatile secondary memory composed of rotating platters coated with a magnetic recording material.  because they are rotating mechanical devices, access times are about 5 to 20 milliseconds and cost per gigabyte in 2012 was $0.05 to $0.10.

**flash memory** -  a nonvolatile semiconductor memory.  it is cheaper and slower than dram but more expensive per bit and faster than magnetic disks.  access times are about 5 to 50 microseconds and cost per gigabyte in 2012 was $0.75 to $1.00.

**local area network lan** -  a network designed to carry data within a geographically confined area, typically within a single building.

**wafer** -  a slice from a silicon ingot no more than 0.1 inches think, used to create chips.

**defect** -  a microscopic flaw in a wafter or in patterning steps that can result in the failure of the die containing that defect.

**die** -  the individual rectangular sections that are cut from a wafer, more informally known as **chips**.

**yield** -  the percentage of good dies from the total number of dies on the wafer.

**response time** -  also called **execution time**.  the total time required for the computer to complete a task, including disk access, memory accesses, i/o activities, operating system overhead, cpu execution time, and so on.

**throughput** -  also called **bandwidth**.  another measure of performance, it is the number of tasks completed per unit time.

**cpu execution time** -  also called **cpu time**.  the actual time the cpu spends computing for a specific task.

**user cpu time** -  the cpu time spent in a program itself.

**system cpu time** -  the cpu time spent in the operating system performing tasks on behalf of the program.

**clock cycle** - also called **tick**, **clock tick**, **clock period**, **clock** or **cycle** is teh time for one clock period, usually of the processor clock, which runs at a constant rate.

**clock period** -  the length of each clock cycle.
