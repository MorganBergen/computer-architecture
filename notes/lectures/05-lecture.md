##  clock cycle time and rate

relationship between clock / cycle time and clock rate

clock rate frequency > clock frequency $f_{c}$

clock rate $f_{c}$ in hertz hz **1 hz = 1 cycle / second**

clock cycle time > time for one cycle $t_{c}$

$t_{c} = 1/f_{c}$

$f_{c} = 1 / t_{c}$

clock cycle time = 1 / clock rate

clock rate = 1 / clock cycle time
