####  computer systems -  a multilevel approach

-  level 5 - problem - oriented language level
-  translation (compiler)
-  level 4 -  assembly language level
-  translation (assembler)
-  level 3 -  operating system machine level
-  partial interpretation (operating system)
-  level 2 -  instruction set architecture level
-  interpretation (microprogram) or direct execution
-  level 1 -  microarchitecture level
-  hardware
-  level 0 -  digital logic level

####  computer architecture

-  a **computer** is a machine that receives inputs; manipulates and or stores data; and provides useful outputs
-  **computer architecture** or the digital computer organization:  is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system.
-  computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems.  computer organization helps optimize performance-based products.

**the role of a building architect vs a computer architect**

-  materials:  steel, concrete, brick, wood, glass
-  goals:  function, cost, safety, ease of construction, energy efficiency, fast building time, aesthetics
-  buildings:  houses, offices apartments, stadiums, museums
-  technology:  logic gates, sram, dram, circuit techniques, packaging, magnetic storage, flash memory
-  goals:  function, performance, reliability, cost / manufacturing, energy efficiency, time to market
-  computers:  desktops, servers, mobile phones, supercomputers, game consoles, embedded
