#  computer architecture assignment 05

1a.  briefly define the cache memory
1b.  with a schematic diagram, explain how data is transferred 
1bi.  between the main memory and cache memory
1bii.  between cache and cpu

2a.  briefly discuss the following cache related terms:  cache line, cache hit, cache miss miss penalty, and average memory access time (amat)

3a.  what is three c's in cache memory hierarchy?
3b.  briefly describe the three c's

4a.  prove that amat = hit time + miss rate * miss penalty.  make any assumptions as needed.

5a.  for a given main memory address, using the figure below explain how to determine if there is a cache hit or a cache miss.

5b.  for a cache hit, how to determine a specific byte value n cache?  note that main memory address fields are index, tag, and offset;  where offset has word and byte fields
