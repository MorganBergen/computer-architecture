**question 1**

**consider a multilevel computer with different interpreters at levels 1, 2, and 3.  an interpreter between levels 1 and 2 takes 4 instructions to process one instruction.  however, an interpreter between levels 2 and 3 takes 3 instructions to process one instruction.  one instruction at level 1 takes 1 nanoseconds to execute.  how long does it take for an instruction at levels 2 and 3?**

**question 2**

**briefly describe at least seven major components and or control signals used to implement a full legv8 datapath.**

**question 3**

**a -  what is pipelining?**

**b -  why is pipelining important?**

**question 4**

**with examples, describe three types of legv8 instructions used to implement a full legv8 datapath.**

**question 5**

**with a schematic diagram, describe the activities of a full legv8 datapath while executing r-type, load & store, and branch instructions.  show all required datapath components and control signals.  do not copy / paste the diagram.  list the assumptions, if you make any.  schematic diagram, description, and activities executing instructions must be included in the answer.**
